# DNS Name Resolver

The DNS Name Resolver is a Python program that resolves host names to their corresponding IP addresses. It takes a list of host names as input from a text file and outputs the corresponding IP addresses to another text file.

## How to Run

To run the DNS Name Resolver program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download the source code from the repository.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program is located.

4. Create a text file named `input.txt` and add the host names you want to resolve, each on a new line.

5. Run the following command:

    ```
    python main.py input.txt output.txt
    ```

    Replace `input.txt` with the path to your input file and `output.txt` with the desired path for the output file.

6. The program will resolve the host names and write the corresponding IP addresses to the `output.txt` file.

7. Open the `output.txt` file to view the resolved IP addresses.

That's it! You have successfully run the DNS Name Resolver program. Feel free to modify the input file and rerun the program as needed.
